              at least 51% of shares must be registered to a UAE/GCC national
              sponsor, a qualified foreign investor that sets up an
              establishment or sole proprietorship to practice a professional
              service is permitted 100% ownership in the company. Establishments
              that are owned by foreign nationals are required to appoint a
              National Service Agent (NSA) to assist in obtaining licenses,
              visas, etc. NSAs have no direct involvement in the business.
              Sovereign can act as the NSA. A sole trader from Dubai may carry
              out commercial or technical activities throughout the Emirates.
              Therefore the obtained license will represent these activities.
              Even if there is no minimum amount to open a sole proprietorship
              in Dubai a person must calculate the amount required to do their
              business.

              Partnership is formed between a minimum of two partners, one is a
              General partner and another is a Limited partner. Sometimes it is
              called 'silent partner" as the partner does not take part in any
              of the business activities or share any profit or losses of the
              business. Limited Partners are liable for a share of company
              liabilities equal to their share of the company capital. The
              company can have more than one branch and every branch can take
              over one or all activities which is included in the primary

              whereas Limited Partners can be nationals of other countries. The
              company name along with the company should have names of the
              General partners but the name of the Limited Partner should not be
              mentioned in the name of the company. A limited partner should not
              interfere in management functions or involve third parties even if
              he/she has the authority to do so. Although a limited partner can
              participate in internal administration. They have full right to
              verify the profit and loss account and the balance sheet and also
              company books and documents if this would not cause damage to the
              company.
